# Blockly Accessibility Demo

This experimental project aims to enhance the accessibility of Blockly by combining the existing keyboard navigation plugin with additional screen reader support. The goal is to make block-based programming more inclusive and accessible to users with visual impairments and mobility limitations.

## Demo

A working demonstration of this accessibility implementation is available at: [https://samarh18.github.io/blockly-accessibility-demo/](https://samarh18.github.io/blockly-accessibility-demo/)

## Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**
  - Navigate the workspace using WASD keys
  - Move between blocks, connections, and fields
  - Access the toolbox and flyout using keyboard shortcuts
  
- **Screen Reader Support**
  - Basic announcements for block navigation
  - Feedback when connecting and disconnecting blocks
  - Information about block types and connections

- **Additional Features**
  - Visual focus indicators to show current selection
  - Shortcut dialog for learning keyboard commands
  - Simple navigation model based on the original keyboard navigation plugin

## Current Status

This project is currently in an experimental phase and is not yet ready for production use. It builds upon the keyboard navigation work by the Blockly team and aims to contribute to making block-based programming accessible to everyone.
